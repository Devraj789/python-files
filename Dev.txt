1.file handling process

Here firstly we do 

 e.g
   f.open("a.py","w")
   f.write("Any text here")
   f.close()
After doing this in cmd we write b.py(name of the file)and then a.py is created then

f.open("a.py","r")
line = f.read()
print(line)
f.close()
here it reads all the text of the contents of a.py



2.map and filter

map and filter both looks like same .but map is used for overall process of changing list
 whereas filter is used while for finding the certain condition son the list 

e.g of map
a = [10,20,30,40]
b = list(map(lambda X:X+2,a))
print(b)

e.g of filter
a = [10,20,30,40]
b = list(filter(lambda X:X%2 ==0 ,a))
print(b)
